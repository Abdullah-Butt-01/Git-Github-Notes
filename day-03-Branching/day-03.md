# Day 03 - Branching

## Objective

Learn what Git is, initiating git and basic commands

## Commands Practiced

* git branch - check which branch you are working in
* git checkout -b <branch-name - create a branch
* git branch -d < branch-name - delete a branch
* git merge <branch-name - merge a branch

## what I did

* Created a branch
* Checked if i am working in branch
* Created Day-03 folder in the branch and worked on it
* Merged the branch with the main branch

## Problems Faced

* When created a file in the branch, it is still visible in the main. The problem was i didn't add the folder to git.

## How I fixed

* I first added the folder into git inside the new branch, then megeged it with the main branch

## Key Learnings
* Branching allows to change, test or remove updates without affecting the main project in parallel timeline
* You have to leave the branch you wanted to delete, you cannot a branch when you are inside it
