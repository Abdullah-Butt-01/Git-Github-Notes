# Git & GitHub Learning

This repository documents my hands-on journey of learning Git and GitHub from scratch.

The goal is not theory, but real usage — the way Git is used in actual development and DevOps workflows.

## What I Practiced

- Git basics: init, status, add, commit
- Working with GitHub: clone, push, pull
- Branching and merging
- Handling mistakes and simple conflicts
- Writing clean commit messages
- Maintaining a proper README

## How This Repo Is Used

- Every concept is practiced using real commands
- Commits are made step-by-step
- Screenshots and notes are added where helpful
- README is updated as learning progresses

## Why This Repo Exists

- To build muscle memory for Git commands
- To follow industry-style version control habits
- To create a transparent learning record for myself and recruiters

## Status
